I am a biology PhD student at Queen's University, Canada. For my PhD research, I assemble and annotate a chromosome-level reference genome for Western Chorus Frog (*Psuedacris triseriata*) and use comparative genomic tools to investigate chromosome evolution in frogs and toads. I use ddRADseq to investigate the sex system and the mito-nuclear discordance in Canadian Western Chorus Frog populations. I anticipate to defend my thesis in December 2024 and to publish my PhD work in 2025. 

I have a diverse skillset, including herpetology and environmental DNA (eDNA) fieldwork, DNA extraction (e.g. salt extraction, Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit, Qiagen MagAttract HMW DNA kit), eDNA extraction (phenol-chloroform protocol), RNA extraction (Qiagen RNeasy kit), histology (skeletochronology), and bioinformatics on genomic data including sanger seqeuencing, ddRAD sequencing, Illumina short-gun whole genome sequencing, 10x Genomics linked read sequencing, PacBio HiFi long read sequencing, Dovetail Omni-C data, and RNA data. 

I am looking for a research position after my PhD, especially on genomic projects. Please contact me if you have a opening position or know other labs have! :)
