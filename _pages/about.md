I am a biology PhD student at Queen's University, Canada. I study the evolutionary history of trilling chorus frogs in eastern Canada. 

In Blog Posts, I share bioinformatic tricks I learned during my research and also some natural history observations.

In Wildlife, I share my photos of wildlife. 

Thank you for visiting my website!
