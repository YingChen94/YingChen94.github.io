I am a biology PhD student at Queen's University, Canada. I study the evolutionary history of trilling chorus frogs in eastern Canada using genomic tools. 

My blogs share about bioinformatic tricks I learned or figured during my research. Hope this will help some of you as well!

In the natural history section I share my photos and observations of wildlife. 

Thank you for visiting my website!
