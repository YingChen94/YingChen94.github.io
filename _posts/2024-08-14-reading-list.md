## A reading list for population genetics

A solid understanding of population genetics theory is necessary and essential for correct interpretation of genomic data and patterns. Here I compiled a list of papers that I found helpful to build up the theoretical foundation. 

### Development of sequencing technology

### Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium
