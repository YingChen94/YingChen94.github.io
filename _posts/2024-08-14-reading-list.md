A solid understanding of population genetics theory is necessary and essential for correct interpretation of genomic data and patterns. Here I compiled a list of papers that I found helpful to build up the knowledge foundation for understanding the theory and analytical methods. 

### Overview articles

- Charlesworth B, Charlesworth D. 2017. Population genetics from 1966 to 2016. Heredity 118(1):2-9. [link](https://doi.org/10.1038/hdy.2016.55) &nbsp; &nbsp; ***Some major questions and controversies in population genetics.***
- Allendorf FW. 2017. Genetics and the conservation of natural populations: allozymes to genomes. Molecular Ecology 26(2):420-430. [link](https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.13948) &nbsp; &nbsp; ***Different types of genetic data.***

### How to test Hardy–Weinberg proportions?

### How to interpret STRUCTURE or ADMIXTURE results?

[link]( https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2012.05754.x) &nbsp; &nbsp; ***Authors advise that results are reported in the form of the graph of the natural logarithm of the likelihood of the data given K (if the Pritchard method was used) and the DK graph (if the Evanno method was used) as well as the bar plot(s) showing individual assignments for the given K or comparison across plausible K values.***

### How to interpret PCA plots?
