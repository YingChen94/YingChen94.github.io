A solid understanding of population genetics theory is necessary and essential for correct interpretation of genomic data and patterns. Here I compiled a list of papers that I found helpful to build up the knowledge foundation for understanding the theory and analytical methods. 

### Different types of genetic data

- Allendorf FW. 2017. Genetics and the conservation of natural populations: allozymes to genomes. Molecular Ecology 26(2):420-430. [link](https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.13948) &nbsp; &nbsp; ***Genome-wide SNPs data is not only powerful as a large quantity of loci to inform average effects of evolutionary processes on the whole genome, but also characterizes variation along different regions of the genome (e.g. runs of homozygosity, regions with low recombination rates, regions resisting introgression).***

### How to test Hardy–Weinberg proportions?

- Waples RS. 2015. Testing for Hardy–Weinberg proportions: have we lost the plot? Journal of Heredity 106(1):1-19. [link](https://doi.org/10.1093/jhered/esu062)

### How to interpret STRUCTURE or ADMIXTURE results?

- Lawson DJ, van Dorp L, Falush D. 2018. A tutorial on how not to over-interpret STRUCTURE and ADMIXTURE bar plots. Nature Communications 9(1):3258. [link](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-05257-7) &nbsp; &nbsp; ***Admixture ancestry can be a result of different demographic histories, inferences of which need to be tested explicitly using other methods.***
